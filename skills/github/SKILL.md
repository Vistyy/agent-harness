description: Triage and orient GitHub repository, pull request, and issue work through `gh` and local git context. Use when the user asks for general GitHub help, wants PR or issue summaries, or needs repository context before choosing a more specific GitHub workflow.

# GitHub

## Overview

Use this skill as the umbrella entrypoint for general GitHub work in the overlay. It should decide whether the task stays in repo and PR triage or should be handed off to a more specific review, CI, or publish workflow.

This workflow is CLI-first:

- Use `gh` for repository, issue, pull request, comment, label, reaction, PR creation, and GitHub Actions workflows.
- Use local `git` for checkout state, current branch, branch creation, commit, and push.
- Keep GitHub state and local checkout context aligned. If the request is about the current branch, resolve the local repo and branch before acting.

Once the intent is clear, route to the specialist skill immediately and do not keep broad GitHub triage in scope longer than needed.

## Responsibilities

Handle these directly in this skill when the request does not need a narrower specialist workflow:

- repository orientation once the repo, PR, issue, or local checkout is identified
- recent PR or issue triage
- PR metadata summaries
- PR patch inspection
- PR comments, labels, and reactions
- issue lookup and summarization
- PR creation after a branch is already pushed

Prefer `gh` JSON output for those flows. If the repository is not already identifiable from the user request or local git context, ask for the repo instead of pretending there is a repo-search flow that may not exist.

## Routing Rules

1. Resolve the operating context first:
   - If the user provides a repository, PR number, issue number, or URL, use that.
   - If the request is about "this branch" or "the current PR", resolve local git context and use `gh` only as needed to discover the branch PR.
   - If the repository is still ambiguous after local inspection, ask for the repo identifier.
2. Classify the request before taking action:
   - `repo or PR triage`: summarize PRs, issues, patches, comments, labels, reactions, or repository state
   - `review follow-up`: unresolved review threads, requested changes, or inline review feedback
   - `CI debugging`: failing checks, Actions logs, or CI root-cause analysis
   - `publish changes`: create or switch branches, stage changes, commit, push, and open a draft PR
3. Route to the specialist skill as soon as the category is clear:
   - Review comments and requested changes: `../gh-address-comments/SKILL.md`
   - Failing GitHub Actions checks: `../gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md`
   - Commit, push, and open PR: `../yeet/SKILL.md`
4. Keep the model consistent after routing:
   - `gh` for GitHub-hosted data and write actions
   - local `git` for checkout and branch state

## Default Workflow

1. Resolve repository and item scope.
2. Gather structured PR or issue context through `gh`.
3. Decide whether the task stays in GitHub triage or needs a specialist skill.
4. Route immediately when the work becomes review follow-up, CI debugging, or publish workflow.
5. End with a clear summary of what was inspected, what changed, and what remains.

## Output Expectations

- For triage requests, return a concise summary of the repository, PR, or issue state and the next likely action.
- For mixed requests, tell the user which specialist path you are taking and why.
- For GitHub write actions, restate the exact PR, issue, label, or reaction target before applying the change.
- Use `gh` for GitHub Actions logs.

## Examples

- "Use GitHub to summarize the open PRs in this repo and tell me what needs attention."
- "Help with this PR."
- "Review the latest comments on PR 482 and tell me what is actionable."
- "Debug the failing checks on this branch."
- "Commit these changes, push them, and open a draft PR."
